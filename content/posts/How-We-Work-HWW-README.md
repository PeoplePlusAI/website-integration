# 💙 How We Work

## Open Collaboration for a +ai Future

* People+ai is a not-for-profit that believes **technology, especially ai,** will cause **paradigm shifts** that can help **India & its people reach their potential.**&#x20;
* **We are not doing this alone.** There are many wonderful people in the country doing amazing things already. **We partner** with organisations of all kinds to figure out how ai can help serve the people.
* We are creating **open spaces** where **partners** **and volunteers** can discover needs, share resources and **collaborate** with each other.
* **Without having to go through us!**&#x20;

This approach is central to our [**Theory of Change**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] which informs [**what we do**,](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] our [**core values**](how-we-work/core-values.md) and this playbook on How We Work.

## About the Community

* We are [**organised as an ecology**](how-we-work/how-we-are-organised.md) of multiple **working-groups** which define and pursue their own ambitious dreams**.**
* Working-groups' dreams are fuelled by **purpose-driven volunteers** and **nurtured by partners** in our ecosystem.&#x20;
* We **build in public** and share all knowledge by default. This happens on our **GitHub.**
* Anyone ready to roll up their sleeves and contribute to a future where technology, especially ai is built in service of people is[ **welcome as a volunteer**](how-we-work/contributing-to-the-community.md)**.**
* Any organisation willing to help discover/ demonstrate/ disseminate population-scale use-cases for ai in India is [**welcome as partner.**](how-we-work/guide-connect-your-org-to-people+ai.md)
